User Story 1

1) As a new user, I should be able to log in using an already existing account.  When a new user wants to try our app, 
they should be prompted to a login page where they can choose to login with Facebook or Google. Upon selecting either, 
they will be prompted to enter their Facebook or Google credentials. If they are entered correctly, they will be taken 
to the dashboard which features a side-bar with preference cities and a map centered on their current location (if 
location is given) or just a map of the world if not. If the fail to enter their credentials, they will be prompted to 
try again.

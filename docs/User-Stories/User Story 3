User Story 3

3)As a logged-in user, I should be able to favorite my frequent cities. As a user, after typing in my favorite city
into the search bar, I should be able to then save it to my favorite locations for easy access in the future. 
I can do so by clicking a checkbox next to the search bar. When I search, it will then be added to a favorites 
list on on the side-bar of my account.

User Story 3

3)As a logged-in user, I should be able to favorite my frequent cities. As a user, after viewing a city as described in 
part 2, I should be able to then save it to my favorite locations for easy access in the future. I can do so by clicking 
a star next to the city name, and it will then be added to a favorites list on on the side-bar of my account as described 
in part 1.

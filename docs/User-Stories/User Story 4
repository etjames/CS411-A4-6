User Story 4

4) As a logged-in user, I should be able to get updates on new news. If I have favorited cities as stated in part 3, 
I should be able to get new notifications when big events happen in the area. By default, I should receive a daily rundown 
but I can change my settings to be more often updates if I like. There will be an audible chime and a box will pop up in 
the top right corner containing information about the news stories.

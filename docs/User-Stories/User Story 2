User Story 2

2) As a logged-in user, I should be able to click and view different cities. Once logged in a user can either enter a 
city of interest into a search bar on the top left or view it on the map, which they are able to navigate using the mouse.
When the user begins typing a city of interest, the search bar will help auto-fill the city-name in a drop-down from the 
search bar. The user can then select this city and the map will travel to be centered on this city. If the city cannot be
found, the drop-down will say “City not found”.

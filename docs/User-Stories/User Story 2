User Story 2

2) As a logged-in user, I should be able to click and view different cities. Once logged in, a user can either enter a 
city of interest into a search bar in the center of the page, or instead click on the option to search by a map instead.
They can view the map, which they are able to navigate using the mouse. The user can select a city and click on the Search 
button to be redirected to the page containing news articles and tweets about this city.

How we chose our technology stack:

For our group, we have decided on node.js, JavaScript, and ejs as the main supports for our project. 

We considered using Python as many of us know the language already, however with Python we would be unable to 
use the same structure for front end and back end. Additionally, we did want to expand our horizons more and 
therefore, wanted to look into alternatives.

Coincidentally, two of our group members are utilizing node.js for another class of theirs. This made it so that
they had some baseline knowledge so our group was not completely starting from scratch, and yet at the same time 
all of us could still be learning and working together. Additionally, node.js allows the front end and back end 
to match up easier and all be in a consistent format.

So far, we have found it relatively easy to understand and get used to, and there are many resources out there 
to aid in our work. We have used many internet resources to give us information about writing the code such as the
expressjs website, code burst, and more.  We have additionaly been using other items such as json and pre-existing ejs 
templates to help support our work. 

We hope as our work continues on we will continue to find ways in which we can use these resources to better our 
final project.

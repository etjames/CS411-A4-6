# CS411-A4-6
Our group- Section A4 Group 6- will use this repository for our CS411 project for Spring Semester 2019.

This project is built using node.js, javascript, and ejs. 

The folder entitled 'views' contains the ejs files which are the visualization the user can see, while the folder
'routes' contains the js files which control activities behind the scenes. 

There are API references not pushed here.

This project is a combination of news media, social media, and locations. We use Google authorization to log our users in.
Then we lead to a homepage which contains a search bar where the user can type in a city name to search. There is also the option to favorite a city on the same page. From this home page, there is also the option to search by a map instead. Either of these search options bring the user to a page with news articles related to the typed in city. Additionally, these news articles are displayed with a drop down option that has tweets containing keywords from the article.

For further information about our app, feel free to look at the 'docs' folder for use cases, proposal, and more. You also can reach out to us with any further questions.
